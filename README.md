<h2>Run_Analysis README</h2>

<p><em>For the original README from the UCI HAR Dataset, please go here: https://github.com/bca6893/Getting-Cleaning-Data/blob/master/README.txt</em>

<p>The run_analysis script uses data collected from an experiment measuring smartphone recognition of human activity. The abstract and citation of this experiment are also included here.</p>

<p>In brief, the data of interest for this script are the subject identifiers (n = 30),  activity labels and names (n = 6), mean and standard deviation variables for each signal (n = 66) and their averages (n = 180). Further description of all variables are available in the codebook.</p>

<p>There are five files in the Getting-Cleaning-Data repository.</p>
<ul>
<li>run_analysis.R: the script used to transform, tidy, and summarise human activity data.</li>
<li>Run_Analysis README: contains information on the files used for data, variables of interest, and references.</li>
<li>Run_Analysis Codebook: this describes the data steps, transformations, and other relevant information.</li>
<li>example_output: this contains snippets of data for a better picture of the final datasets. </li>
<li>dataset_averages.txt: the averages dataset in full.
</ul>

<p>The files used in the script are listed here.</p>
<ul>
<li>features.txt: a set of all features in the database (i.e., used for measure names)</li>
<li>activity_labels.txt: numeric activity labels and their respective names</li>
<li>X_train.txt, X_test.txt: training and test measure data</li>
<li>y_train.txt, y_test.txt: training and test labels (i.e., activity labels)</li>
<li>subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt: training and test subject IDs</li>
</ul>

<p>Abstract: Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.</p>
